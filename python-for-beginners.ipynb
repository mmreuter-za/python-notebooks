    "LowClass Python: Style Guide for Data Scientists\n",
    "================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This style guide is meant for use by advanced beginner to advanced intermediate developers of scientific code in Python. In other words, non-professional programmers...for example, data scientists. The term _LowClass Python_ hints at reducing the use of object oriented design. It is an attempt to be as witty as [Tom Anderson](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Etom) when he coined the term _C++--_ (C plus-plus, minus-minus). You see, C++ is a very rich language with many features. This allows a variety of abstract design patterns that can result in confusing and hard to maintain code. In [that essay](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Etom/c++example/c++.pdf), professor Anderson encourages limiting your use of the C++ language to a smaller set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to C++, Python allows a variety of coding styles and abstraction and some limits can help. The limits depends on who is writing the code and for whom. Our perspective is that of a data scientist who is writing a model to be used by others as part of a larger system. An example would be a feature extractor that reads _streaming_ (through stdin/stdout) text data and counts the number of times different words appear. The data scientist should be able to prototype the model using a smaller collection of text files (stored on his laptop). Once the model is working, it should be easy for the scientist to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Work with other data scientists to integrate the feature extractor into a much larger prototype. Here the challenge is fitting together and maintaining code written by many different people.\n",
    "2.  Work with engineers to _productionalize_ this model. Here the challenge is that the code must be scaled and maintained by people who have not worked on and may not understand the underlying algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: We're not saying the patterns found below are the only way to write LowClass Python. We have however found them effective. Comments and discussion is welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of source code from scripts\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is ok to write quick and dirty scripts to get some job done (e.g. replacing words in a file). These should be kept in a separate directory than the _source_ code, which needs to follow the other conventions in this guide. Keep in mind that as scripts grow, you will be expected to make them adhere to this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial reading\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Read and follow [Code like a pythonista](http://python.net/%7Egoodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html).\n",
    "*   Find a tutorial on Object Oriented Design (OOD) in Python and make sure you understand how to create a class and understand attributes and methods. Make sure you've worked through one example of class inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some rules\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard basic style-guide is [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Read this from beginning until the Version Bookkeeping section. Here we present some additions/clarifications/modifications. The reason for consistency in style is that it makes it easier for others to read and grep your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use 4 spaces per indentation level. This is absolutely essential since code that uses different indentation cannot be used together! Tabs cannot be used. This does not mean you have to hit the space bar four times. Every decent text editor has a setting that allows you to map the tab key to spaces.\n",
    "*   Limit lines to some pre-determined number of characters. 79 is the accepted standard and to contribute to many projects you will need to adhere to this.\n",
    "*   Try to limit functions to 50 lines (not including doc strings). If a function is longer than 50 lines you have probably made it do too many things. Something close to 20 lines should be your average.\n",
    "*   Don't use abbreviations unless the word will be used many many times. If you're worried about having to type long names, then learn to use tab complete. The only short names that are acceptable are common math names such as x, y, X, Y, t, and counters such as i, j, k (used ONLY for the normal purposes). Note that it is standard convention to _never_ use single letters as variable names, and to only use lower case letters and underscores...so we're breaking from Python programming convention here in the name of conforming to math/stats/ML convention.\n",
    "*   Try to be consistent with names across multiple functions. In other words, don't use the full name in one location and an abbreviation elsewhere.\n",

    "Simplicity\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple is better!\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "While designing and writing code, the goal of simplicity should be foremost in your mind. Your code must be understood, used, and maintained by many different people, over long time periods. Adding additional complexity to your code forces these people to do unnecessary work. This is rude and causes mistakes. This principle is sometimes called [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A very simple useful pattern is to write functions that take well-defined inputs and produce well-defined output. You tie these together with code that reads like a book. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    def extract_feature_counts(data_string):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Some docstring here...\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The only _public_ function is `extract_feature_counts` (the other functions start with an underscore). This means that a user should look first at the function `extract_feature_counts`.\n",
    "*   Upon looking at `extract_feature_counts`, the user can easily see that the extraction consists of two steps, cleaning and counting words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware of feature creep\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Feature creep_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) is a phenomenon where additional functionality added to your code becomes excessive. A _feature_ could be an additional method in a class, or an optional keyword argument in a function. Instead of helping, this practice complicates matters for current and future developers. Here are some guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Only create features that are needed now...not at some potential time in the future. This is known as the principle, [You aren't gonna need it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI)\n",
    "*   Sometimes features are added with the intention of making calling the code easier. Before doing this, stop and consider the fact that this feature will have to be maintained by you and others for a long time over many different code changes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyModel(object):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Implements a classification model.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        def trim_variables(self):\n",
    "            trimmed_variable_names = self.variables\n",
    "            # some code to eliminate variables from trimmed_variable_names.\n",
    "            self.variables = trimmed_variable_names\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def fit(self, X, Y):\n",
    "            # some code to fit coefficients to self.variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def trim_and_fit(X, Y):\n",
    "            self.trim_variables()\n",
    "            self.fit(X, Y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Is the method `trim_and_fit` really needed? Sure, it will save you from making two separate calls (one to `trim_variables` and one to `fit`), but it will have to be maintained by someone. If the API to either `trim_variables` or `fit` changes, then so will the API to `trim_and_fit`. If the preferred steps for fitting and trimming changes, then this method may become extinct. A user of this class needs to understand the functionality of all three methods now. Note that we are not saying this convenience method should not be written. It's just that the convenience must be weighed against the work that you are asking others to do when they attempt to use and maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Be especially careful with features that are part of a large system (e.g. options in a function that is part of a data processing pipeline). Every time someone ties one program to another, they will have to consider what state every feature will be in. This causes a headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit is better than implicit\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Give variables, methods, and attributes descriptive names. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for person in person_list:\n",
    "        age_years = todays_date - person.birthdate\n",
    "        age_days = age_years * 365\n",
    "        age_factor = np.sqrt(age_days) * age_multiplier\n",
    "        age_factor_list.append(age_factor)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we used the full name of every variable. Writing out `age_factor` makes it more memorable. We can grep the code and find find all places where `age_factor` appears. Notice we also use `age_factor_list` rather than `age_factors`. `age_factor` and `age_factors` are barely distinguishable and if both are variable names they will often be inadvertently swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being explicit while setting attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyModel(object):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, training_data):\n",
    "            self.X, self.Y = self._get_XY(training_data)\n",

    "            self.model_has_been_fit = True\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for returning X and Y (rather than setting them inside a method called e.g. `self._set_XY` is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It pushes attribute setting up to the highest level (in `__init__`). This allows you to read `__init__` and see as much useful information as possible (in particular, that the attribute names `X` and `Y` will be used).\n",
    "2.  It encourages a functional style of programming, minimizing [side effects](#side-effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `fit` method, notice that\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We ONLY fit the model and set attributes directly related to fitting.\n",
    "*   Since attribute setting is the \"output\" of this method, it is put at the end (just as a return call from a function would be put at the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit use of optional (keyword) arguments\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Options should be optional. The code should work fine without them.\n",

    "*   The `fit` method is an example of a method that uses the data. It should (and does) set the coefficients and an attribute to tell you that the model has been fit. A common mishap is to also transform the X, Y data within `fit`. For example, we could rescale self.X and self.Y. This would be a [side effect](#side-effects) and should be avoided.\n",

Only using these coefficients can we predict (using `self.predict()`). What if the user wanted to store the (lightweight) coefficients in a file, and then use them at some point in the future to make predictions on new data? What if a user wanted to use a subset of the training data to fit (in e.g. cross validation). Neither of these could be done! This sort of difficulty can be seen in the [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) package, which was meant to be used to analyze one non-changing piece of data, rather than predict on multiple new pieces of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "A _side effect_ in programming occurs when a function/method is called and unintended data or state is modified. This can produce difficult to detect bugs. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The attributes of an object determine its _state_ and hence its behavior. If an attribute is modified, then the behavior of the object changes. For example, the `predict` method of `MyModel` depends on `self.coefficients`. If `self.coefficients` are modified, then `self.predict()` has, in effect, changed. An alternative to storing `self.coefficients` would be to return coefficients and make the user store them. This may be more or less complicated, but please be aware of the trade offs.\n",
    "*   You can cut down on side effects by giving methods very explicit names and making sure the functionality coincides with the name. For example, the method `get_data_stats` returns (i.e. _gets_) some statistics related to the data and _nothing more_. If someone wanted to also modify an attribute `self.stats` they would be \"forced\" to do this in a separate call (e.g. `self.data_stats = self._get_data_stats()`.\n",
    "*   Try googling _side effects in object oriented design_ and you can enjoy reading some other rants about side effects.\n",

    "### Multiple inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which a class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one superclass. This results in significantly more complicated code and should not be used in LowClass Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some more guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Push attribute modification to the highest level possible. Complex math should be in functions that return a value (that can then be used to set an attribute). This allows developers to see when and how an attribute is being modified without digging into the math.\n",
    "*   Since attributes determine state and they can end up being modified in unexpected ways, please limit the number of attributes you create.\n",
    "*   Don't write _uber methods_. An _uber method_ is a method that does lots of things at once. For example, you could have a method that initializes a few attributes, modifies self.X, self .Y, and returns Z. This may make it easy to perform some common task with one simple method call. However, (i) if one of these tasks need to be modified, you may destroy the ability to perform the other tasks. (ii), it is difficult to understand the code in these methods. (iii) Good luck writing unit tests!\n",
